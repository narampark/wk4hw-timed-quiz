# <Week-4-Timed-Quiz>

## Description
This project was done to create a webpage that starts a timed quiz on JavaScript. When the user starts the quiz the timer will start counting down from 60. Submitting a correct answer will move the user to the next question. Submitting an incorrect answer will move the user to the next question but also deduct 5 seconds from the remaining time. When the quiz is over, either through answering all the question or running out of time, the total score will be given and the user will be given a prompt to enter their initials. The given user initials and their score will show up on the highscores section of the homepage.
